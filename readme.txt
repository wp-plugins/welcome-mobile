Display a welcome message to users browsing your site on smartphones.

== Description ==

Display a welcome message to users browsing your site on smartphones. Choose between Android and iOS or use a default message for all mobile platforms. You can either use built-in visual editor or output your own HTML code.

**NOTE:** Welcome message will always be displayed every time the user visits your site unless she clicks on the close button in which case cookie gets stored locally. Message will not be visible unless the cookie expires (20 days by default) or gets deleted.

Welcome! Mobile uses two main components to work:

* [mobiledetect](http://mobiledetect.net/) for detecting mobile devices
* [JavaScript Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) to handle the cookie used for showing the message to visitors

Additionaly, mobile platform detection is done via JavaScript, so if a mobile phone browser doesn't support or run JavaScript (which is highly unlikely) plugin won't function properly.

Head over to Support section or visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/mladimatija/Welcome-Mobile) project page for support for this plugin.
